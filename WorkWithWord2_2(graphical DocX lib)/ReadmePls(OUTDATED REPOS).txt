Project is dead. =)
There is a fatal bug in Word, which happens almost everytime after 4-10 added templates to the Base, resulting in about 50 last templates added to the Word file are missing their styles. (the styles are correct, but they don't display properly - there is only a blue underlined text (WTF WORD?))
Seems like it happens because everytime the template is added to the Base, it also bring it's duplicates of Word Styles.
Playing around with different combinations of check on/off in Word Style settings doesn't change the thing, also edited templtate still doesn't fix the problem.

I already have about 100 tabs in my Browser to save, and i can't f*cking do it, because of this.
Moreover, i should have done lot of things different, since i've learned smth from then, and a lot on new features. This bring us to the last tesis of this text.

I learned the bacics of SQL, so, i'm going to implement a normal database on my PC, with nice and handy app/apps to ADD, DISPLAY, etc. stuff in it.
A also wanna learn WPF Framework, since it's much newer, recommended and uses DirectX. I'm starting today to combine all this in a pretty simple base with nice graphics outputs and prints and same for inputs.
So, GL HF 4 me!)
